# VBA-challenge

Homework assignment #2

I apologize, I am still learning the difference between GitLab and GitHub, so I initially pushed my assignment to GitLab. I am resubmitting it now in a repo in GitHub.

I have uploaded 3 screenshots of the spreadsheet Multiple_year_stock_data for years 2014, 2015, and 2016.
I have uploaded the VBA script I created in Visual Studio Code and used in Microsoft Visual Basic for Multiple_year_stock_data.

I did my best and worked with my teacher for 1.5 hours after class, but we could not figure out how to fix my code so that it would run for all of the data. My code breaks partway through in every sheet.
I would appreciate any insight you can offer into how I can fix my code so that it runs all the way through the data. If I am able to find a solution, I plan to re-upload my work at a later date.
